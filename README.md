# hello-world
I am taking my first step in this interesting world of computer science. 
Hmmm
Somehow I am curious with the possibilities of AI's evolution, and it's potential applications in mental health.
Which path will it take? 
How far will it go/get to? 
As we just passed 2020, I believe the question how fast we will get there is relevant as well.
Something tells me, I will find something interesting about myself/humanity; in my bid to understand AI, observe, maybe contribute to their evolution. If possible, work with them.
May I get to meet and learn from great teachers, and honour them, in this conquest of mine; by probably finding a solution or two for mental healthcare issues before I die. Hello-world :)
